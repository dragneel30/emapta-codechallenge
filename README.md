# Code challenge written in react native typescript

# Here are the libraries I used throughout the code challenge


*react-native-paper* - Mainly for UI/UX to support material design. This is the most comfortable UI library to me.


*react-native-config* - To have separated config for the environment variables. I dont like mixing up environment configs with react native code.


*moment* - Mainly for datetime related operations. I use this instead of native Date because I am comfortable with it.



other libraries in package.json are dependencies.
